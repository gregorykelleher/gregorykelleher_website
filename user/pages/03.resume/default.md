My name's Gregory Kelleher and I'm an undergrad studying Computer Science at Maynooth University. 

I have a strong interest in IoT, Web development and microprocessor development boards such as the Intel Galileo/Edison. This is often reflected in the work I do and I dedicate my time to building resources around what I accomplish. 

Likewise, I'm always conscious in sharing what I do with the wider community, be it online or teaching classes at CTYI or even every Thursday at CoderDojo. I also maintain a blog that I keep up to date regularly, and post the odd video on my YouTube channel every now and then.

Besides tinkering with things in my own time, I also attend Dublin Maker Faire annually and most recently partook at Science Hack-Day Dublin - winning UCD's Innovation Academy Education Award.

##Recent Work
**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2016**

I was an Educator at DCU's Centre of Talented Youth Ireland for 3 months teaching a class of 20 students on Gizmos and Gadgets. As part of the class, I taught using Intel Galileos and other IoT development boards, demonstrating how to build complete circuits and create embedded projects.

**Centre of Talented Youth Ireland • Educator • Jan 2016 - March 2017**

Granted to be an Educator at DCU's Centre of Talented Youth Ireland again for a further 3 months. The course is based upon teaching students computer gaming using GameMaker software and tools.

**CoderDojo Ireland • Demonstrator • Sept 2015 - Current**

CoderDojo is a a free computer programming club for young people of all ages. I volunteer each Thursday in my local Dojo at Maynooth University.

**Web Development • Freelancing • Current**

I've designed, built and hosted websites/web-applications over the past few years for a number of clients. It's a great way for me to polish my skills and learn new ones. I always deliver on mobile-ready performant applications, built to the latest standards.

##Projects

**Maynooth University Student Planner • University Project • Sept 2016 - Jan 2017**

As part of my university programme I had to produce a web application as part of a team. Over the course of a semester we developed and deployed an online student planner application called MuHub using modern web technologies. The application was built using AngularJS with the Material UI component framework, supported by Firebase database & hosting. You can read more in my two-part series [here](http://www.gregorykelleher.com/blog/angularjs_project).

**Arduino Rover • Robotics Project • Aug 2014 - May 2015**

Back in 2014 I decided to build an Arduino semi-autonomous rover from scratch, as a challenge to myself. It carries an infrared distance sensor, camera on swivel mount and an Xbee radio module. It can be set to full autonomous mode or alternatively be controlled over Xbee using an X-Box controller. I later had the opportunity of presenting it at Dublin Maker Faire in 2015. You can read more about it here or instead watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv33IRn4F5Q).

**Online Animated tutorials • YouTube Channel • Jan 2015 - Current**

I maintain a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Spokkam) online where I post educational tutorial videos on electronics and similar material. Many of my videos contain my own animation (usually motion graphics) that I design in Illustrator and later animate using After Effects. Since its inception, it's continued to grow and I've amassed over 6000 views to date.
