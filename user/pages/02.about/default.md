Hi, my name's Gregory Kelleher. 

I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Maynooth University. I enjoy learning and discovering all things 'tech', and as such, I inevitably find myself engaged in a range of activities. Whether configuring my web server, tinkering with electronics or dabbling in projects; I'm almost always at the keyboard.
