Hi, my name's Gregory Kelleher.

I'm a software engineer employed at Overstock. Whether inside or outside the office, I enjoy learning and discovering all things 'tech'.

As such, I inevitably find myself engaged in a range of activities. Whether configuring my web server, tinkering with electronics or dabbling in projects; I'm almost always at the keyboard.

Oh and in my spare time I also like to üèÑ
