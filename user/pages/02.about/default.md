Hi, my name's Gregory Kelleher. 

I'm a student currently in my final year of Computer Science at Maynooth University. As such, I inevitably find myself engaged in a range of activities. Whether configuring my web server, tinkering with electronics or dabbling in projects; I'm almost always at the keyboard.
